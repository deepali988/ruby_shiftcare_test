# ShiftCare Technical Challenge

This is a minimalist command-line application built in Ruby that allows you to search for clients by name and find clients with duplicate emails based on a JSON dataset.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have the `clients.json` file in the same directory as the Ruby script. You can use the provided `clients.json` file or replace it with your own dataset following the same format.

## Usage

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you have the Ruby script and the `clients.json` file.

3. Run the Ruby script by entering the following command:

   ```bash
   ruby shiftcare.rb
